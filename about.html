		<p>Now, this is the story all about how
 My life got flipped-turned upside down
 And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
 I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air

In West Philadelphia, born and raised
 On the playground is where I spent most of my days
 Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool
 And all shootin' some B-ball outside of the school

When a couple of guys who were up to no good
 Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood
 I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
 And said, "You're movin' with your aunty and uncle in Bel Air"

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
 The license plate said fresh and had a dice in the mirror
 If anything I could say that this cab was rare
 But I thought, nah forget it, yo home to Bel Air

I pulled up to the house about seven or eight
 And I yelled to the cabby, "Yo homes, smell you later"
 Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there
 To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel Air
